# ToDone

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.5.

This is intended to function as a very basic To-Do list management.  It allows you to quickly enter items you need to do.  You can then select those items and a side panel will be exposed allowing you to enter sub-task items.  Each item can be completed individually, or the entire todo item can be marked complete.

You can also delete individual subtasks, or the entire todo item.

The reason for implementing this app is because I found that during my day-to-day work, I would use a text editor to record items that I needed to do which would take the for of

```
* item to do
** sub item to do #1
** sub item to do #2
```

It made sense to create an app that I could use that would provide a bit more functionality.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
